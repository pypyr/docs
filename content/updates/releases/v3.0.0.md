Release Date: 2019-08-22T17:47:35Z

- BREAKING CHANGE: Remove deprecated step input context for (ref #118)
    - assert
    - env
    - fetchjson
    - fetchyaml
    - fileformat
    - fileformatjson
    - fileformatyaml
    - filereplace
    - tar
- BREAKING CHANGE: cli context input now uses standard cli spacing rather than needing to str close everything. Closes #94
    - So where you had:
    - `pypyr mypipeline "key1=value1,key2=value2”`
    - Now instead:
    - `pypyr mypipeline key1=value1 key2=value2`
- BREAKING CHANGE: Big API changes to pipelinerunner, stepsrunner and Step
- BREAKING CHANGE: *pypyr.parser.commas* replaced by *pypyr.parser.keys*
- Caching pipelines, context parsers, loaders, step run functions. Basically cache anything that loads from disk. Closes #126
- Custom step groups. Closes #126
- Jump, Call, and Stop ref #128 #127 #123
- The ./pipelines default directory location no longer necessary. To run a pipeline `./dir/mypipe.yaml`, just go `pypyr dir/mypipe`
- README+help updates for all of the above
