# pypyr release v2.3.0
## pypyr.steps.getenv
Release Date: 2019-01-24T02:18:47Z

- add new step _pypyr.steps.getenv_ Whereas _pypyr.steps.env_ raises an error if you are getting an environment variable that doesn't exist, the new _envget_ allows you to specify a default value to use instead. ref #111 
- some documentation updates to demonstrate how to use py strings for ternary assignments
- built-in pypes use _comment_ rather than _description_ where output is not meant for operator consumption ref #109 
- alias the `--loglevel` switch with `--log`, so you can now do `pypyr mypipe --log 10` think of the savings just on keyboard wear and tear!
