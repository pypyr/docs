## Dynamic pype loading and KeyNotInContextError == KeyError
Release Date: 2019-01-18T10:34:45Z

This release is all @Reskov! 🎉 Much thanks for your excellent contributions to some tricky bits of the pypyr core! 
- Context KeyNotInContextError now also derives from KeyError. This makes it easier to catch missing key exceptions in scenarios where Context keys contain other dicts.
- Allow dynamic loading of pipeline loaders. This allows core extensibility to load pipelines differently and from other places than the default file loader. Plugins can now do things like `myplugin.pypeloaders.getpypefromsomewhere` closes #106
