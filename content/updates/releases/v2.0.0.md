## Sic Strings, Py Strings, Fetch into Key and file write yaml/json
Release Date: 2018-12-16T20:19:49Z

- pypyr v2.0.0 release!
- BREAKING CHANGES:
   - [sic] strings are now a lot better. Instead of relying on string-parsing on "[sic]" and the tricky use of quotes and double-quotes, now a structural yam tag identifies sic string, making it a whole lot simpler to write sic strings with special characters in them without escape sequences or having to deal with `{blah}` style eye-bleeding messes. This does mean, however, that old style "[sic]" strings won't work anymore.
- new features:
  - Py Strings. These allow dynamic eval of python expressions anywhere you can use a string formatting expression in a pipeline. Thank you to  @Reskov for the idea, and working through the scenarios and options!
  - Write yaml or json to disk using `pypyr.steps.filewriteyaml` and `pypyr.steps.filewritejson`
  - The yaml and json fetchers can now write their payloads to a specified context key, rather than to the root of context.
  - the usual updates to README and examples.
