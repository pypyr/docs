# pypyr release v3.1.0
## API change to main entrypoint for logging
Release Date: 2020-02-11T19:24:11Z

`pypyr.log.logger.set_root_logger(log_level, log_path)` call moved from `pipelinerunner.main()` to `cli.main()`

this has the side-effect that `pipelinerunner.main()` signature has changed, with `log_level` and `log_path` removed. API consumers should update. 

Reason being API consumers should set their own log handlers, since handler configuration should be the prerogative of the calling application, not the invoked library.
