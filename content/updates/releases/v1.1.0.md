# pypyr release v1.1.0
## cli: --logpath + py 3.7
Release Date: 2018-10-18T22:01:10Z

- cli option to log to a file path in addition to the console using `--logpath`. With great thanks to @rickardcronholm!
- slight BREAKING CHANGE for `--loglevel`: The previous shortening to `pypyr mypipe --log 10` won't work anymore. Use `pypyr mypipe --logl 10` if you don't want to type out `--loglevel`
- python 3.7 compatibility
- README help with shell examples
