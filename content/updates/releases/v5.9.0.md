# pypyr release v5.9.0
## string loader
Release Date: 2023-09-21T08:21:12Z

## summary
- Add new [pypyr.loaders.string]({{< ref "/docs/loaders/string" >}}) loader that
  loads pipelines directly from strings. 

```python
from pypyr import pipelinerunner

pipeline = """\
steps:
- name: pypyr.steps.set
  in:
    set:
      test: 1
"""

context = pipelinerunner.run(pipeline_name=pipeline,
                             loader="pypyr.loaders.string")

assert context["test"] == 1
```

- Fix bug with `!jsonify` custom tags failing to load with error
  "ruamel.yaml.constructor.ConstructorError: could not determine a constructor
  for the tag '!jsonify'".
  -  this was due to a regression in the ruamel dependency
