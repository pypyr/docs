# pypyr release v3.0.2
## Better error messages on failing import modules
Release Date: 2019-11-18T19:30:27Z

* When importing a step that does exist (`mystep.blah`), a failing `import mymodule.blah` inside `mystep.blah` would give a misleading error and hide the actual source of the problem. Fixes #166. Eternal thanks to @irancati for raising the issue!
