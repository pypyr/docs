## less confusing logging with NOTIFY
Release Date: 2019-08-06T21:16:03Z

This one is all @Reskov ðŸŽ‰ eternal gratitude!

* new NOTIFY logging level added. this level is much less verbose than even INFO, and only displays explicits echos that you specify in your pipeline, and also the description from the step decorator. This should make it much easier to see what your pipeline is doing without the extra detail that can make things confusing and harder to follow. #132
* under-the-hood api improvement for more performant logging #152
