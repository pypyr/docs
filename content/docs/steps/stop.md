# pypyr.steps.stop
## stop pypyr immediately
Stop all pypyr processing immediately. Doesn't run any success or
failure handlers, it just stops everything in its tracks, even when
you're nested in child pipelines or a step-group call-chain.

You can always use `pypyr.steps.stop` as a simple step, because it doesn't
need any input context properties.

If you use a Stop instruction inside a 
[failure handler]({{< ref "/docs/getting-started/error-handling#failure-handlers" >}}) 
it will stop processing at that point AND not quit reporting failure. Do this 
when you want to handle an error condition and not raise an error to the caller.

## example
```yaml
- name: pypyr.steps.echo
  in:
    echoMe: you'll see me...
- pypyr.steps.stop
- name: pypyr.steps.echo
  in:
    echoMe: you WON'T see me...
```

See a worked [example to stop all processing](https://github.com/pypyr/pypyr-example/blob/master/pipelines/stop.yaml).
