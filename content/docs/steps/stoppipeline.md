# pypyr.steps.stoppipeline
## stop current pipeline immediately
Stop current pipeline. Doesn't run any success or failure handlers, it
just stops the current pipeline.

This is handy if you are using [pypyr.steps.pype]({{< ref "pype" >}}) to call 
child pipelines from a parent pipeline, allowing you to stop just a child
pipeline but letting the parent pipeline continue.

You can always use `pypyr.steps.stoppipeline` as a simple step, because it 
doesn't need any input context properties.

If you use a Stop pipeline instruction inside a 
[failure handler]({{< ref "/docs/getting-started/error-handling#failure-handlers" >}}) 
it will stop processing at that point AND not quit reporting failure. Do this 
when you want to handle an error condition and not raise an error to the caller.

## example
```yaml
- name: pypyr.steps.echo
  in:
    echoMe: you'll see me...
- pypyr.steps.stoppipeline
- name: pypyr.steps.echo
  in:
    echoMe: you WON'T see me...
```
