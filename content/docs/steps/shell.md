## run commands in default shell
Runs the context value `cmd` in the default shell. On a sensible O/S, this is 
`/bin/sh`, or more recently `zsh`.

Do all the things you can't do with [cmd]({{< ref "cmd" >}}). `cmd` runs a 
program or executable, `shell` invokes the actual system shell. This means
all your shell expressions are available, such as your favorite bashisms.

If you are just looking to run a command with arguments, you do not need to use
`shell`, you can use `cmd` instead, which will incur less processing overhead. 

## set shell commands
Input context can take one of two forms:

```yaml
- name: pypyr.steps.shell
  description: passing cmd as a string doesn't save the output to context.
               prints stdout in real-time.
  in:
    cmd: 'echo ${PWD}'
- name: pypyr.steps.shell
  description: passing cmd as a dict allows you to specify if you want to
               save the output to context.
               prints command output only AFTER it has finished running.
  in:
    cmd:
      run: 'echo ${PWD}'
      save: True
      cwd: './set/current/working/dir/here'
```

All inputs support [substitutions]({{< ref "/docs/substitutions">}}).

### changing working directory
If you specify `cwd`, it will change the current working directory to `cwd` to 
execute this command. The directory change is only for the duration of this 
step, not any subsequent steps.

When you do set `cwd`, the executable or program specified in `run` is relative 
to the `cwd`. `cwd` itself is relative to the over-all pypyr working directory.

If you do not specify `cwd`, it defaults to the current working directory, 
which is from wherever you are running `pypyr`.

### capture shell output
Be aware that if `save` is `True`, all of the command output ends up in
memory. Don't specify it unless your pipeline actually uses the stdout/stderr
response in subsequent steps.

Keep in mind that if the invoked command has a non-zero return code pypyr will 
automatically raise a `CalledProcessError` and stop the pipeline - in other 
words, you do not have to set `save` to `True` to handle the output in
case of error, the pipeline will stop and report the error automatically. If 
this is not the behavior you want, you can suppress errors with the 
[swallow decorator]({{< ref "/docs/decorators/swallow">}}) and use the 
[runErrors]({{< ref "/docs/getting-started/error-handling" >}}) list on 
subsequent steps. Only use `save: True` when you actually need the stdout or 
stderr output.

If `save` is `True`, pypyr will save the output to context as follows:

```yaml
cmdOut:
    returncode: 0
    stdout: 'stdout str here. None if empty.'
    stderr: 'stderr str here. None if empty.'
```

`cmdOut.returncode` is the exit status of the called process. Typically
0 means OK. A negative value -N indicates that the child was terminated
by signal N (POSIX only).

You can use cmdOut in subsequent steps like this:

```yaml
- name: pypyr.steps.echo
  run: !py "cmdOut['returncode'] == 0"
  in:
    echoMe: "you'll only see me if cmd ran successfully with return code 0.
            the command output was: {cmdOut[stdout]}"
```

## examples
Example pipeline yaml using a pipe:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: pypyr.steps.shell
    comment: if you have something pipey in working dir it should show up
    in:
      cmd: ls | grep pipe
  - name: pypyr.steps.shell
    comment: if you want to pass curlies to the shell, use sic strings
    in:
      cmd: !sic echo ${PWD};
```

See a worked [example for shell pipeline power](https://github.com/pypyr/pypyr-example/tree/master/pipelines/shell.yaml).

## multiple inline shell statements
Friendly reminder of the difference between separating your shell statements
with `;` or `&&`:

-   `;` will continue to the next statement even if the previous command
    errored. It won't exit with an error code if it wasn't the last
    statement.
-   `&&` stops and exits reporting error on first error.

You can change directory multiple times during this shell step using
`cd`, but dir changes are only in scope for subsequent commands in this
step, not for subsequent steps. Instead prefer using the `cwd` input as
described above for an easy life, which sets the working directory for
the entire step without you having to code it in with chained shell
commands.

```yaml
- name: pypyr.steps.shell
  comment: hop one up from current working dir.
           sic means won't attempt to 
           substitute {PWD} from context, so
           shell will interpret it as the $ENV.
  in:
    cmd: !sic echo ${PWD}; cd ../; echo ${PWD}
- name: pypyr.steps.shell
  comment: back to your current working dir
  in:
    cmd: !sic echo ${PWD}
```
