# pypyr.steps.debug
## debug the context
Pretty print the context to output.

Print the pypyr context to the pypyr output. This is likely to be the
console. This may assist in debugging when trying to see what values are
what.

debug prints to the INFO (20) log-level. This means you won't see debug
output unless you specify `pypyr mypype --log 20` or lower value for `log`. If
you have values you that _always_ want to print to output, 
[echo]({{< ref "echo" >}}) is the more natural step to use.

Obviously, be aware that if you have sensitive values like passwords in
your context you probably want to be careful about this. No duh.

All inputs are optional. This means you can run debug in a pipeline as a
simple step just with:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: my.arb.step
    in:
      arb: arb1
  - pypyr.steps.debug # use debug as a simple step, with no config
  - name: another.arb.step
    in:
      another: value
```

In this case it will dump the entire context as is without applying
formatting. 

## optional inputs
Debug supports the following optional inputs:

```yaml
debug: # optional
  keys: keytodump # optional. str for a single key name to print.
                  # or a list of key names to print ['key1', 'key2'].
                  # if not specified, print entire context.
  format: False # optional. Boolean, defaults False.
                # Applies formatting expressions to output.
```
