# pypyr.steps.fileformatjson
## find & replace tokens in json
Parses input json file and substitutes {tokens} from the pypyr context.

Pretty much does the same thing as 
[pypyr.steps.fileformat]({{< ref "fileformat" >}}), only it makes it
easier to work with curly braces for substitutions without tripping over
the json's structural braces.

Given input json like this:
```json
{
  "k1": "v1",
  "k2": {
    "k2.1": "v2.1",
    "k2.2": [
      "2.2.1",
      "START {replaceMeNested} END"
    ]
  },
  "k3": "{replaceMeString}",
  "k4": "{replaceMeInt}",
  "k5": "{replaceMeBool}",
  "{replaceMeKey}": "this will replace the key"
}
```

And a pipeline like this:
```yaml
steps:
  - name: pypyr.steps.fileformatjson
    comment: read json file, do some substitutions, write back out.
    in:
      replaceMeString: this was replaced by pypyr
      replaceMeInt: 420
      replaceMeBool: false
      replaceMeNested: doesn't matter where you are in the nesting structure
      fileFormatJson:
        in: ./sample-files/sample.json
        out: ./out/
```

The formatted output json file will be:
```json
{
  "k1": "v1",
  "k2": {
    "k2.1": "v2.1",
    "k2.2": [
      "2.2.1",
      "START doesn't matter where you are in the nesting structure END"
    ]
  },
  "k3": "this was replaced by pypyr",
  "k4": 420,
  "k5": false,
  "keyfrompypyr": "this will replace the key"
}
```

## type-safe token replacement
Notice that you can replace values in the json document and keep the correct 
type - so numbers are numbers, booleans are booleans and so forth.

Even though you always have to set the `"{replacement_expression}"` inside 
quotes in the source json to ensure valid json, pypyr will output the correct 
type based on the value to which the expression evaluates.

You can also use replacement expressions in the json object's keys.

## multiple files & globs
`fileformatjson` expects the following context keys:

- `fileFormatJson`
    - `in`
      - Mandatory path(s) to source file on disk.
      - This can be a string path to a single file, or a glob, or a list of 
        paths and/or globs. 
      - Each path can be a glob, a relative or absolute path.
    - `out` (optional)
      - Write output file to here. Will create directories in path if these do 
        not exist already.

See [file format settings]({{< ref "fileformat#file-format-settings" >}}) for 
more examples on in/out path handling - the same processing rules apply.

Example with a glob input:

```yaml
fileFormatJson:
  in: ./testfiles/sub3/**/*.txt
  # note the dir separator at the end.
  # since >1 in files, out can only be a dir.
  out: ./out/replace/
```

If you do not specify `out`, it will over-write (i.e in-place edit) all the 
files specified by `in`.

The file in and out paths support 
[substitutions]({{< ref "docs/substitutions">}}), which allows you to specify
paths dynamically.

See a worked [example of fileformatjson](https://github.com/pypyr/pypyr-example/blob/master/pipelines/fileformatjson.yaml).
