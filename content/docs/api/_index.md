# the pypyr api
You can easily extend pypyr with your own custom steps, cli input arguments & 
you can invoke pipelines programmatically from the API.

Don't be put off & think of this as advanced functionality: it is very much 
the idea of how to use pypyr effectively. Specifically making your own custom
step is likely to be a regular activity - and happily, you can do so with a 
single simple function signature.
