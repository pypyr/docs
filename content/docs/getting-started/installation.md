# install pypyr
## pip
```bash
$ pip install pypyr
```

### upgrades
Use the standard pip upgrade switch:

```bash
$ pip install --upgrade pypyr
```

## python version
Tested against Python >=3.6

## docker
Stuck with an older version of python? Want to run pypyr in an
environment that you don't control, like a CI server somewhere?

You can use the official [pypyr docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/pypyr/pypyr/)
as a drop-in replacement for the pypyr executable.

```bash
$ docker run pypyr/pypyr echo "Ceci n'est pas une pipe"
```
