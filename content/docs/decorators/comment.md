## comment your pipeline code
Similar to code comments, `comment` is for pipeline authors to annotate a 
pipeline step for the usual reasons. Like remembering why on earth you did
something in a certain way two weeks later.

`comment` does not output at run-time ever. If you're looking to add descriptive
text that prints to output for pipeline consumer visibility, use 
[description]({{<ref "description">}}) instead.

```yaml
- name: pypyr.steps.contextsetf
  comment: this comment is for pipeline authors.
           it is multi-line to prove a point.
           it probably describes a technical point
           about why the step is doing something.
  in:
    contextSetf:
      newKey: 'XXX {invalue} XXX'
```
