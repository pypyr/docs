# Built-in pipelines
pypyr comes with with some basic pipelines out of the box. These don't do much, 
nor can they: the whole idea is for you to write your own awesome pipelines 
because it so so easy!

pipeline  | description     | how to run
--------------|---------------------|---------------
donothing     | Does what it says. Nothing.| `pypyr donothing`
echo          | Echos context value echoMe to output.| `pypyr echo text goes here`            
pypyrversion  | Prints the python cli version number.| `pypyr pypyrversion`
magritte      | Thoughts about pipes.| `pypyr magritte`
