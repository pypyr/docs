# pipeline yaml structure
## pypyr pipeline format
A pipeline is a .yaml file. pypyr uses YAML version 1.2.

Save pipelines wherever you please. To run a pipeline, execute
`pypyr pipelinename` from the directory where you saved
`pipelinename.yaml`

```yaml
# This is an example showing the anatomy of a pypyr pipeline
# A pipeline should be saved as {working dir}/mypipelinename.yaml.
# Run the pipeline from {working dir} like this: pypyr mypipelinename

# optional. set this to pass cli arguments to the pipeline.
context_parser: my.custom.parser

# mandatory.
steps: # step-group. every pipeline starts with steps unless you tell pypyr differently.
  - my.package.my.module # simple step pointing at a python module in a package
  - mymodule # simple step pointing at a python file
  - name: my.package.another.module # complex step. It contains a description and in parameters.
    description: Optional description is for humans. It's any text that makes your life easier.
    in: # optional. Set these key-value pairs in context for this step.
      parameter1: value1
      parameter2: value2
    run: True # optional. Runs this step if True, skips step if False. Defaults True if not specified.
    skip: False # optional. Skips this step if True, runs step if False. Defaults False if not specified.
    swallow: False # optional. Swallows any errors raised by the step. Defaults False if not specified.

# optional.
on_success: # step-group
  - my.first.success.step
  - my.second.success.step

# optional.
on_failure: # step-group
  - my.failure.handler.step
  - my.failure.handler.notifier
```

You don't have to specify `on_success` and/or `on_failure` if you don't feel
the need. pypyr will just skip these if you don't set them.

## step groups
### default step groups
pypyr looks for 3 different step groups on a default run:

- `steps`
- `on_success` (optional)
- `on_failure` (optional)

So:

```yaml
# the default pypyr step-groups
steps: # 'steps' is the default step-group that runs 1st
  - steps.step1 # will run ./steps/step1.py
  - arb.step2 # will run ./arb/step2.py

on_success: # on_success executes when pipeline completes successfully
  - success_step # will run ./success_step.py

on_failure: # on_failure executes whenever pipeline hits an error
  - steps.failure_step # will run ./steps/failure_step.py
```

#### steps
`steps` is a list of steps to execute in sequence. A step is simply a bit of
python that does stuff.

`steps` is the default entry-point for a pypyr pipeline. This means that if you
run a pipeline like so

{{< app-window title="term" lang="fish" >}}
$ pypyr mypipe bread circuses
{{< /app-window >}}

pypyr will looks for the `steps` group in `./mypipe.yaml` as an entry-point.
*bread* and *circuses* are the context arguments that the context-parser can use
to initialize the context.

You can use pypyr's built-in steps, or you can very easily make your own custom
steps. Don't hesitate to [roll your own step]({{< ref "/docs/api/step" >}}), 
it's really easy, no jokes!

#### on_success
`on_success` is a list of steps to execute in sequence. Runs when `steps:`
completes successfully. This is optional: if `on_success` isn't specified,
pypyr will just finish the pipeline reporting success without a problem.

You can use pypyr's [built-in steps]({{< ref "/docs/steps" >}}) or code your own
steps that you use exactly like you would for the `steps` step-group - it uses
the same function signature.

`on_success` is handy if your pipeline [jumps]({{< ref "/docs/steps/jump.md" >}})
between different step-groups but you still want to run a common sequence
at the end after everything is done.

Typical uses are to send a notification or do some clean-up when the pipeline 
sequence completes.

#### on_failure
`on_failure` is a list of steps to execute in sequence. Runs when any of the above
hits an unhandled exception.

This is optional: if `on_failure` isn't specified, pypyr will just finish the
pipeline reporting the error.

See here for more details on 
[how failure handlers work]({{< ref "/docs/getting-started/error-handling#failure-handlers">}}).

When `on_failure` completes, pypyr will quit and report an error, with a non-zero
exit code. In other words, `on_failure` doesn't swallow the exception for you,
it just gives you the opportunity to do something about it. If you want to 
cancel the error condition, see how to 
[quit failure handler without raising error]({{< ref "/docs/getting-started/error-handling#dont-quit-pipeline-reporting-failure">}}).

If `on_failure` encounters another exception while processing an exception, then
pypyr will log and report both that exception and the original cause's 
exception, although the original cause exception is what pypyr highlights on 
CLI exit and raises to API consumers.

You can use built-in steps or code your own steps exactly like you would for
the `steps` step-group - it uses the same function signature.

### custom step groups
You don't have to stick to these default step-groups, though. You can specify
your own step-groups, or mix in your own step-groups with the defaults.

```yaml
# ./step-groups-example.yaml
sg1:
  - name: pypyr.steps.echo
    in:
      echoMe: sg1.1
  - name: pypyr.steps.echo
    in:
      echoMe: sg1.2
sg2:
  - name: pypyr.steps.echo
    in:
      echoMe: sg2.1
  - name: pypyr.steps.echo
    in:
      echoMe: sg2.2
sg3:
  - name: pypyr.steps.echo
    in:
      echoMe: sg3.1
  - name: pypyr.steps.echo
    in:
      echoMe: sg3.2
sg4:
  - name: pypyr.steps.echo
    in:
      echoMe: sg4.1
  - name: pypyr.steps.echo
    in:
      echoMe: sg4.2
```

You can use the `--groups` switch to specify which groups you want to run and
in what order:

{{< app-window title="term" lang="fish" >}}
$ pypyr step-groups-example --groups sg2 sg1 sg3
{{< /app-window >}}

This command will run, in order, `sg2` -> `sg1` -> `sg3`

Here's a ready cooked example of [custom step-groups in action](https://github.com/pypyr/pypyr-example/blob/master/pipelines/step-groups.yaml).

If you don't specify `--groups` pypyr will just look for the standard
`steps` group as per usual. You can still [call]({{< ref "/docs/steps/call.md" >}}) 
or [jump]({{< ref "/docs/steps/jump.md" >}}) to other step-groups from the 
default `steps` group, so you could think of `steps` a bit like the `main()` 
entry-point in traditional programming.

```yaml
# ./steps-with-custom-group.yaml
# use steps as default entry point
steps:
  - name: pypyr.steps.echo
    in:
      echoMe: begin
  - name: pypyr.steps.jump
    in:
      jump: my_group

my_group:
  - name: pypyr.steps.echo
    in:
      echoMe: my_group step 1
  - name: pypyr.steps.echo
    in:
      echoMe: my_group step 2

# default on_success runs after everything complete
on_success:
  - name: pypyr.steps.echo
    in:
      echoMe: end!
```

This will result in:
{{< app-window title="term" lang="text" >}}
$ pypyr steps-with-custom-group
begin
my_group step 1
my_group step 2
end!
{{< /app-window >}}
