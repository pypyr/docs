## what is pypyr?
pypyr is an open source task-runner for automation pipelines. pypyr lets you 
script sequential tasks in a simple yaml format with conditional execution, 
loops, error handling and retries for any step in your pipeline. 

Like a turbo-charged shell script, but less finicky. Less tricky than a 
makefile.

You can run loops, conditionally execute steps based on conditions you specify, 
wait for status changes before continuing, break on failure conditions or 
swallow errors. 

Pretty useful for orchestrating continuous integration, continuous deployment 
(CI/CD) and devops operations.

pypyr runs as a simple CLI, or you can use it from your own code via the 
undemanding Python API.
